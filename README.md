# COURSES

# CSE 102
This is an introductory course to programming: The course aims to teach students how to write programs in the C programming language and how to read existing programs. It aims to provide students with the experience of creating problem solutions as algorithmic steps and expressing them in a programming language. The ultimate goal is to enable students to prepare software that can be used by others. 
Includes 12 homeworks.
  
# CSE 211
Providing information about discrete structures and the foundations of discrete mathematics. Explaining the applications of discrete mathematics in computer science to help students understand this relationship.
Includes 3 homeworks.
  
# CSE 222
To teach fundamental data structures and algorithms that can be used in designing software solutions for problems and introduce data structures and algorithms.
Includes 8 homeworks.
  
# CSE 232
The course aims to teach students the fundamentals of logic design, synthesis, and verification using hardware description languages. It focuses on constantly evolving applications of basic computer design concepts with strong connections to real-world technology.
Includes 4 homeworks.

# CSE 241
To explain the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and introduce the syntax structure of object-oriented programming.
Includes 8 homeworks.

# CSE 321
The aim of this course is to teach students various fundamental algorithms that can be used to solve everyday problems. It includes analyzing these algorithms from different perspectives, such as their runtime, memory usage, and energy consumption. The course also covers comparing their performances and teaching algorithm design methods.
Includes 5 homeworks.

# CSE 331
The course aims to teach assembly programming and the assembly command architecture. It strives to enable students to apply computer arithmetic and design ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units). It also covers designing and modifying MIPS single-cycle, multi-cycle, and pipelined computer architectures from scratch. Students will be able to calculate the performance of different computer architectures under different test programs and analyze virtual memory and cache organization.
Includes 4 homeworks.

# CSE 341
The course aims to introduce the fundamental concepts of programming languages and compare the differences between various languages.
Includes 4 homeworks.

# CSE 343
The course aims to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills for the Software Engineering field in a workplace setting. It provides students with the expertise to work as team members or team leaders effectively. By utilizing the latest technologies, the course offers hands-on experience in applying software engineering methodologies to a predefined project. Students will also learn to develop systematic documentation required throughout the software development life cycle as a part of a software development team.
Includes 2 homeworks.

# CSE 344
This course is intended for under graduate students in computer engineering, the main objective of the course is to present the fundamental aspects of systems programming.
Includes 4 homeworks, 1 midterm and 1 final.
