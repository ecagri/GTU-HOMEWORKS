Google Colab Link of my classifier: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1V39N7EKkUn-Qr3A3oLN56CGeEX5CqeFD?usp=sharing

It may takes longer than 50 minutes to train the model. It uses 50K data points and relatively complex model.

I also added the code in Google Colab as "classifier.py" just in case. It may not working because of lack of libraries. Please contact me if Google Colab link does not work.

The data is got from Wikipedia Turkish dump and saved as "wiki_00".

!!! YOU MUST UPLOAD "wiki_00" FILE TO COLAB NOTEBOOK. !!!
